            <p>
                Established in <strong>2025</strong>, ShelfScape started as a small idea out of a passion for books and technology.
                As an IT student, I recognized the growing need and desire to create an online space where readers could browse, discover, and purchase their favorite books with ease.
                What began as a passion project has now evolved into a fully functional e-commerce platform. 
                We have built a community of passionate readers who share our love for literature.
